## Introduction

The Step Counter project aims to provide a simple and efficient way to count your steps using the M5Stack device and its integrated IMU. By utilizing the IMU's accelerometer, we can detect motion and infer the number of steps taken.

This repository contains all the necessary code and resources required to set up the step counter on your M5Stack device. The project is open-source, and we encourage contributions from the community to enhance its functionality.
